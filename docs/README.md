# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

This project is a machine learning solution designed to predict customer churn for a telecom company. It uses customer data including demographics, services subscribed, account info, and contract details to build a model that can predict whether a customer is likely to leave.

## 🚀 Features

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Handling Imbalanced Data (SMOTE)
- Multiple Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Streamlit App for Interactive Churn Prediction
- Fully documented with Sphinx and ReadTheDocs
