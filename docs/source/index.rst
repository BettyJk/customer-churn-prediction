Welcome to the Customer Churn Prediction Documentation!
========================================================

 **Customer churn** is a critical business problem, especially in industries like telecom, SaaS, and subscription services. This project aims to develop a robust machine learning pipeline that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn, using real-world data and modern data science practices.

This documentation will guide you through every component of the project — from raw data understanding to full model deployment — with detailed explanations and reproducible steps.

.. note::

   This project is open-source and built for educational and analytical purposes. Contributions are welcome!
